On my Journey of the observation of the Magnetic Tape I discovered different Aspects of the Tape.
What stood out for me was the impact of the Delay Effect on Music History. The Delay Effect got first properly used with two Reel-to-Reel-Tape-Machines in the 1940‘s & 1950’s.
For my Setup (see Figure 1) I used a Analog Drum Machine (i.) as Input Device, two Revox Tape Recorders (ii.) for recording & reading the Magnetic Tape (iii.), a small Mixing-Console (iv.) which is essential for acompliance oft the Effect and a Monitor Speaker as Output Device (v.).
The Drum Machine was given an Impulse Signal which made a multiple Drum Noise on the first Semiquaver of a Bar which was played at 42.0 Beats per Minute. This was done to hear the Delay-/ Echo-Effect properly at the Installation as there is a gap of a couple of Seconds until you are able to hear the Effect for the first Time.
